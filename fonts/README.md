# What's this folder used for?

- Purpose: The "fonts" folder is used to store font files that are used for text styling within a project.
- Contents: Font files come in various formats, such as TTF (TrueType Font), OTF (OpenType Font), or other font file formats. These files define the visual appearance of text, including typeface, size, and style.
- Usage: Graphic designers, web developers, and content creators use the "fonts" folder to manage the fonts used in their projects. Keeping fonts organized helps maintain consistency in design and ensures that the intended typefaces are readily available for use.
